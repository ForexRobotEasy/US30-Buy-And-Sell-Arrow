# US30 Buy And Sell Arrow

This is a custom indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify high probability buy and sell signals for the US30 (Dow Jones Industrial Average) trading instrument. The indicator is based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and generates arrows on the chart to indicate potential buying and selling opportunities.

## Indicator Input Parameters

- **Timeframe**: This parameter allows you to select the timeframe for the indicator. The default value is 0, which represents the current timeframe.
- **SoundFile**: This parameter specifies the sound file to be played when a signal is generated. The default value is 'alert.wav'.

## Global Variables

- **BuySignal**: This boolean variable is set to true when a buy signal is generated.
- **SellSignal**: This boolean variable is set to true when a sell signal is generated.

## Custom Indicator Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the indicator is initialized. In this function, the indicator's short name is set to 'US30 Buy/Sell Arrow' and the arrow styles and buffers are configured.

## Custom Indicator Iteration Function

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new bar on the chart. In this function, the RSI is calculated for each bar and compared to the overbought and oversold levels. If the RSI is above the overbought level, a sell signal is generated and the SellSignal variable is set to true. If the RSI is below the oversold level, a buy signal is generated and the BuySignal variable is set to true. Additionally, a sound alert is played when a signal is generated.

## Product Description

This custom indicator, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, aims to provide traders with high probability buy and sell signals for the US30 trading instrument. It utilizes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market.

When the RSI exceeds the overbought level (70), a sell signal is generated and indicated by a downward arrow on the chart. Conversely, when the RSI falls below the oversold level (30), a buy signal is generated and indicated by an upward arrow on the chart.

Traders can use these signals to make informed trading decisions and potentially capitalize on profitable opportunities in the US30 market.
